        <h1>What are  we made of ?</h1>
        <p>
        Compoed of ultra-pure natural organic ingredient, Ex Prūnīs Antioxidant Treatment Oil — the ultimate in skin recovery — concentrates all the power of natural anti-oxidative treasures in a few drops. It delivers concentrated beneficial nutrients for enhanced regeneration and skin protection against environmental aggressors and free radicals. The result is a refined and rejuvenated complexion.
        </p>
        <p>
        Made in small batches in southwestern France, each batch of our Ex Prūnīs goes through analysis that guarantees the presence of these micro-nutrients. At the same time, the control of external contaminants, including heavy metals, ensures an extraordinary purity.
        </p>
        <p>
        Protects, softens, deeply moisturizes, and strengthens your skin's protective barrier.
        Ex Prūnīs is multi-functional beauty oil. It works as an intensive antioxidant treatment on all skin types and also hair! It is sensorial-rich nourishing oil with a marzipan-like scent that protects your skin against oxidative stress and supports its protective barrier.
        </p>
        <p>Whenever possible, we give preference to upcycled raw materials that would otherwise be discarded, provided they hold extraordinary biological potential. Seeds are an excellent example here.</p>

        <p>The Ente plum famed in France has an incredible antioxidant potential much of which is in its seeds. These are unfortunately not edile. By slow mechanical process, however, these seeds yield a precious golden oil with very high levels of valuable antioxidants beneficial for the skin.Instead of adding synthetic or methylated substitutes to our skincare, we find an ingredient with high antioxidant levels and excellent stability.</p>

        <h1>Our product</h1>
        <p>
         ZERO-WASTE: During our production, we use upcycling that prevents the formation of waste. We also collect our packaging back for re-use and upcycling and will soon replace all our boxes with starch-based bags to carry our products.
        </p>
        <p>
        NEVER DILUTED: We never add water and alcohol to our skincare to keep it at its most potent. Moreover, an independent lab analyzes each fresh batch for its antioxidant content and fatty-acid composition to guarantee efficacy.
        </p>
        <p>
        TOXIC-FREE: Our ingredients undergo an independent laboratory testing for heavy metals, mycotoxins, and pesticides, to offer the best beauty product that is unbiased and safe.
        </p>
        <p>
        
        <h2>Product-Ingredients-Philosophy</h2>

        <p>Quality, transparency, and environmental concerns become challenging when one sources ingredients from multiple suppliers across various continents. Certified organic is never a guarantee of purity per se.</p>

        </p>That is why we at Phaedra Botanicals answer to the ethical code of sourcing the minimum of 70% of our products from the organic farming within the European Union. Furthermore, all our ingredients undergo a review of purity and effectiveness and must be fully traceable to their place of origin. Only then we consider it.</p>

        <p>We also give preference to quality over quantity, selecting a few ingredients of exceptional bio-potency. Most brands provide their customers with long ingredient lists while having insufficient knowledge of how one component might impact the bio-dynamics of another, a matter not distinguishable without comprehensive scientific analysis.</p>
