          <h3>Can I use Ex Prūnīs with my other products?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. Ex Prūnīs works wonderfully with day and night creams. Just add
            a couple of drops to your favorite day or night cream or a
            moisturizer to boost their nourishing properties and to add the EX
            PRŪNĪS signature scent.

          <h3>How fast will I see the results?</h3>
          <p>
            Oleic acid can instantly make your skin feel smoother. For this
            reason, many notice a difference overnight. However, only frequent
            use can lead to a significant decrease in the appearance of fine
            lines and sunspots.

          <h3>For what skin type is the Ex Prūnīs best suited?</h3>
          <p>
            EX PRŪNĪS works wonders on all skin types. It is well-suited for dry
            and mature skin, but as a non-comedogenic oil, it works beautifully
            also on acne-prone skin. Free of essential oils and any additives,
            it is well-suited for ultra-sensitive, dehydrated, as well as
            allergy-prone skin.

          <h3>Is it safe to use during pregnancy?</h3>
          <p>
            Each fresh batch of EX PRŪNĪS Antioxidant Treatment Oil undergoes a
            strict analysis of its active ingredients with tight control of
            undesirable contaminants that are present in the modern environment
            such as heavy metals. The aforementioned goes hand in hand with our
            decision to keep EX PRŪNĪS free from essential oils, some of which
            might not be safe for use during pregnancy. EX PRŪNĪS is 100% pure
            and free from any additives.

          <h3>What is the shelf life?</h3>
          <p>
            Once opened, we recommend using the oil within six months to enjoy
            most of its natural properties. However, the condition of storing is
            crucial for the preservation of the active ingredients within and
            its properties. Keep EX PRŪNĪS away from direct sunlight and away
            from extreme temperatures and always tightly closed when not in use.

          <h3>Is it tested on animals?</h3>
          <p>
            No. European legislation does not allow any testing on animals,
            which is the reason why it is against the law to state that a
            cosmetic brand does not carry out such tests, including the
            cruelty-free label. In our raw material selection, the welfare of
            animals is critical for our decisions. It is one of the reasons why
            we chose organic ingredients intending to prevent any use of
            synthetic chemicals that can lead to toxicity in pollinating insects
            and additional adverse impact on the habitat and local biodiversity.
